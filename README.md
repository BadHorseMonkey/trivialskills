# trivialskills
A simple ASH script to automate using the "trivial" skills in KoL
## Usage
Type "trivialskills NUM" into the KoLmafia gCLI, where NUM is the number of times you want to cast each trivial skill.
So "trivialskills 10" will cast each trivial skill ten (10) times.
## What does it do?
It does exactly what I wrote above **and also** makes intelligent use of the [April Shower Thoughts shield](https://kol.coldfront.net/thekolwiki/index.php/April_Shower_Thoughts_shield) if you have one.
## What else does it do?
What more do you want? It's my first ASH script, folks. We all start somewhere. ðŸš¸
